The goal of this project was to create a program that takes in information about a loan applicant, evaluates their credit risk and outputs whether the bank should approve the loan or not. I ran multiple classification models, eventually tuning a SVM classifier that had a 76% accuracy rate. Finally, I created a simple program that outputs whether the bank should approve a loan for a new applicant. 

The first part walks through my solution, including data preprocessing, exploration, and model comparison. In the next section I tune my final model. Lastly, there is a simple program at the bottom. You can enter data about a new customer and the program will output whether they quality for a loan or not.
