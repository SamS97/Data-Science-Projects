This project was my honors thesis project at Arizona State. The project was to create the most accurate jodel possible that could predict the price trend of Bitcoin. The solution was not only to use a neural network to analyze price data but to analyze Bitcoin Twitter data using sentiment analysis as well. I was able to achieve a moddel that predicted 75% of the price trends accurately. Sentiment analysis improved model performance by 22%!
