# Data-Science-Projects

A portfolio of my data science projects. I am a graduate student at Arizona State University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Big Data Systems. The projects found here are focused on adding value to a business, whether that be through customer acquisition, evaluating an investment opportunity, predicting the value of future assets, etc. Enjoy!
